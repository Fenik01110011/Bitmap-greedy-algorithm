# Bitmap-greedy-algorithm
The program searches the path from one point to another on a 100/100 map. It uses a greedy algorithm that compares the average times it takes to pass given fields around. He chooses a square that is easiest to travel to and counts the time to leave the current square and enter the next one. The program shows the path that must be followed to reach the goal, although it is not always the optimal path to be found, because it is a greedy algorithm. The program has an automatic road search and step mode, where each step is performed by pressing any key. The types of obstacles (fields) and the map are loaded into RAM from txt files. The program displays the total time it took to travel the route to the current position and shows the current position. The map is displayed graphically mainly by changing the background colors of the console or applying special characters.
